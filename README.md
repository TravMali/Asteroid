My first Lua+Love2D game

I am setting out to make my first game in Lua. The basic premise is to make something super basic and simple in order to get a grasp not only on Love2D, but Lua as well.
Lua was chosen because I feel it to be one of the most powerful and valuable languages. It's notable for it's embeddability and speed. As I move on to more professional projects, I am optimistic that Lua will be of great use.
Love2D was chosen purely because of it's simplicity.
Having already worked with Codename1 and Java, I am excited to compare and contrast what these extremely different stacks have to offer.
